This study evaluates the ability of a gamified educational
Virtual Reality simulation to complement traditional teaching
and convey information in a multimodal way (visual
and auditory). The simulation was designed to distribute
simplified knowledge of the human immune system and vaccination,
with the overarching issue being raising awareness
on vaccine safety and importance. The simulation was evaluated
in-situ at a local school in Denmark with 20 grade
school pupils from two classes and found, on average, a 9%
knowledge improvement after the VR experience.
